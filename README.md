# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

Created following this tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/building-scalable-graphql-apis-on-aws-with-cdk-and-aws-appsync/

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


## App Root

./lib/learnappsync-cdk-app-stack.ts

This is the root of the CDK app and where we will be writing the code for our app.
